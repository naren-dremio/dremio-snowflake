## Development

Building and Installation
-----------

1. In root directory with the pom.xml file run `mvn clean install`
2. Take the resulting .jar file in the target folder and put it in the <DREMIO_HOME>\jars folder in Dremio
3. Download the Snowflake JDBC driver from (https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/net.snowflake/snowflake-jdbc/3.8.6 and click on the JAR link) and put in in the <DREMIO_HOME>\jars\3rdparty folder
4. Restart Dremio

Debugging
-----------
To debug pushdowns for queries set the following line in `logback.xml`

```<logger name="com.dremio.exec.store.jdbc.dialect.arp.ArpYaml">
    <level value="${dremio.log.level:-trace}"/>
  </logger>
 ```
  
You can then notice lines like below in server.log file after which you can revist the YAML file to add pushdowns based on [Snowflake SQL Reference](https://docs.snowflake.net/manuals/sql-reference-commands.html):
